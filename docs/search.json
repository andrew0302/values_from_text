    "text": "We estimate ICC2k overall, and for subgroups separately. For our lyrics pilot, we observe overall ‘good’ ICC2k estimates, with the exception of SELF-DIRECTION, which shows a large confidence interval that exceeds our threshold. These ICC2k scores overall do not appear to improve when we estimate them separately for each Ethnicity.\n\nThis is not the case for our two pilots which used political speech data. Overall, agreement on the speech data was unusably poor, however it appeared to improve when estimated separately for each ethnicity, with most values showing ICC2k scores over the threshold. Note that estimation for HEDONISM is generally poor in subsamples, and that STIMULATION is poor in some subsamples.\n\nWe observe similar results for our second speeches pilot, which show substantially higher ICC2k scores when they are estimated separately for each political spectrum category.\n\n\n\nWe tentatively conclude that Ethnicity will have a substantially smaller effect on ratings of song lyrics than either Ethnicity or Political Spectrum will have on ratings of speeches. Thus, the sample for our main study data collection will be stratified by Ethnicity, and for political speeches, it will also be stratified by political affiliation.\n\n\n\n\nThe results from our bootstrapping procedure show adequate ICC2k scores with 15 ratings for lyrics, in both ICC2k scores, and correlations between subsample means and the overall mean.\n\nFor both samples in our speech pilots, we observe a bimodal distribution in ICC2k scores, with peaks nearing our threshold, but also around 0.\nOur sample of annotators in our first speeches pilot were stratified by Ethncitiy. Our bootstrapping analysis shows sufficiently high correlations between subsample means and the overall mean at around 40 ratings, however, ICC2k scores do not reach sufficiently high ICC2k scores even with 50 ratings.\n\nOur sample of annotators in our first speeches pilot were stratified by political affiliation. We observe a similar pattern, where the correlations between subsample means and the overall mean reach our threshold 35 ratings, but ICC2k scores are not sufficiently high even with 50 ratings.\n\n\n\nWe thus proceed with a target median 15 ratings per song lyric excerpt. Based on bootstrapped correlations between subsamples and the overall sample, as well as budgetary constraints, we aim for median 40 ratings per political speech excerpt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe take a first look at the SSVS by examining multidimensional scaling plots from participant self-ratings, and compare these to the canonical Schwartz circumplex illustration:\n\nWe further compare to an MDS plot from the correlation matrix reported in a landmark study. In general, the aim of the test is to observe whether values appear next to the appropriate neighbor; note that absolute position is not relevant.\nAlthough not identical, and not quite as circular as expected, we do observe most of the expected patterns. As we also see in the landmark study, not every point aligns with the canonical illustration.\n\n\n\n\nIn contrast to our pilot study, in general we observe sufficient ICC2k scores, with no visible improvement when estimated by ethnicity or political leaning.\nICC2k scores for lyrics ratings appear to be exceptionally high overall, and when estimated separately within Ethnic groups, and do not seem to improve when estimated separately for each Ethnic group.\n\nRatings of political speeches exceed our threshold overall, though ratings do not always meet the threshold when estimated separately within Ethnic groups. In general, the estimates are visibly worse than for lyrics. Once again, we see issues with HEDONISM being poorly estimated for one group, and STIMULATION is poorly estimated for another group.\n\nWe observe a similar pattern when separating groups by political affiliation.\n\n\n\n\nWhen examining the MDS plots for our lyrics annotations, we generally see acceptable patterns with most values appearing next to appropriate neighbors, although STIMULATION and HEDONISM appear transposed, and ACHEIVEMENT shows a shift from the perimeter of the circumplex. These patterns are visibly worse for speeches, where we observe a strong shift for HEDONISM from the perimeter of the circumplex.\n\n\n\n\nWe then determine a general modelling approach in order to estimate the effect of Ethnicity on ratings of lyrics, and Ethnicity and Political spectrum on ratings of political speeches.\nTo do so we plot the observed vs. predicted values and estimate a pseudo R^2, for three models:\n\ngeneral linear mixed effects model (lmer)\nordinal mixed effects model (clmm)\ngeneralized linear mixed effects logistic model (glmer)\n\nModel fit was slightly worse for Lyrics:\n\nthan for speeches:\n\nor for speeches with spectrum also being estimated in place of Ethnicity:\n\n\n\nModel fit was consistently worse for ordinal mixed effects models, vs. general or generalized linear mixed effects models. We thus proceed to our specification curve analysis using general mixed effects models for ease of interpretation and computation."
